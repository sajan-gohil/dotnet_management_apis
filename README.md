# Dotnet Management APIs & Mini Project Manager

## Overview
This repository contains two full-stack applications developed as part of home assignments:

1. **Basic Task Manager**
2. **Mini Project Manager**

Both projects use C# (.NET 8) for the backend and React + TypeScript for the frontend. All required functionalities have been implemented, including scheduling. The applications have not been deployed yet.
